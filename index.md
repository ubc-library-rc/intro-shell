# Introduction to the Unix Shell

This workshop is adapted from [The Carpentries](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice).

## Overview

1. What is a command shell?
2. Navigating the file system
3. Working with files and directories
4. Creating and searching files
5. Combining commands and automating actions

## Setup

Please bring a laptop to this workshop. We will be using the Unix shell for most of the workshop. If you have a Mac or a Linux laptop you don't need to install or enable anything. If you are using a Windows 10 PC you will need to turn on the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” setting as per [Simplified Installation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#simplified-installation-for-windows-insiders). If you need help or are using an older version of Windows please get in touch at [jess.yao@ubc.ca](mailto:jess.yao@ubc.ca).

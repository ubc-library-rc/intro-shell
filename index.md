## Introduction to the Unix Shell

This workshop is adapted from The Carpentries. 

### Overview

1. What is the shell?
2. Navigating the file system
3. Working with files and directories
4. Automating with loops
5. Working with text

### Setup

Please bring a laptop to this workshop. We will be using the Unix shell for most of the workshop. If you have a Mac or a Linux laptop you don't need to install or enable anything. If you are using a Windows10 PC you will need to turn on the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” setting as per [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36352627/how-to-enable-bash-in-windows-10-developer-preview/36465000#36465000). If you need help or are using an older version of Windows please get in touch at [eka.grguric@ubc.ca](mailto:eka.grguric@ubc.ca).

Download the data folder [located here](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-shell/setup.html) in the Library Carpentry Shell Lesson and save it to your desktop. We will be using these files in the second half of this session.
